# crime
A simple search that maps out Hyde Park's crime instances that uses information from UCPD's [incident reports website](https://incidentreports.uchicago.edu/incidentReportArchive.php). 

#### intent
Though Marlon Lynch and the Safety, Security & Civic Affairs administration emails the occassional security alert for when something has occured on campus, we wanted to bring attention to the full range of crimes to occur in the Hyde Park neighborhood, especially when visually plotted out on a map. We thought it'd be important for students to be able to know for themselves the via an uncomplicated, usable interface.
